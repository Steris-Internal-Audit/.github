At Steris, security is one of the most important pillars of the organization
We are completely transparent, and look to share data with other organizations and improve mutually

# Technology - "I remember back in the 80's using Audit Command Language and going through all the code" - Joe
- We use cutting edge technology like Excel and Vlookups to manage millions of rows of data
- Tableau Prep is becoming an extremely useful tool, we don't know what it does yet, but it looks fancy.
- SQL looks really difficult so we rely on folders of Exceluu sheets
- Python and R or any other programming language our Analytics manager is afraid to learn, so we stick wit the basics

# Security
- We value above all security, yet our Internal Audit Manager can't spend 10 minutes putting passwords on files he directs creation of
- We value open source and sharing of data

# Careers
- It's a tradition to tell candidates they will be working with a tool set, then provide them Excel only and except them to handle millions of rows of data

# Disabilities
- Need not apply
- HR enjoys bullying those with disabilities more than most employees
- Harassment is common practice for getting employees to leave, if not, then our method of making up false accusations is our favorite method

# Compensation
- No upward mobility and we pay much less for any technology based role, because we do things the old fashioned way, printers are the future
